# Fibonacci-Sequence-Generator

This program aims to compute the fibonacci sequence in **O(n)** time. It generates the first **n** integers in the Fibonacci sequence given that n is *greater than or equal* to 0. If **n** meets this requirements, fibonnaci_sequence_generator will output a list of all the numbers in the Fibonnaci sequence. For example, if **n** is *equal to* 6, then it will output ```[0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5]```. This program tests the ability to implement a simple yet elegant solution to a classic algorithmic problem while also considering the importance of performance optimization when scaling to larger inputs.
